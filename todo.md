1. Tools should have there own usecase instructions and commands.
2. Tools should dictate what is added to the context (not the full output history)
3. Tools should maintain state and have specific commands for mutating state.


Next:
    - create "projects" to work on
    - multiple agents for different projects, possibly have a single controller agent
    - security - having a screening agent.
    - handle program args and initial flags better
    - create a better controller program that allows for saving and interacting with different agents and projects


Bugs:
Make instructions clearer, about what the agent has access too at a given time
When commands are not run correctly it is not added to context.

shell tool needs to update context correctly

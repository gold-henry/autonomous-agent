Directive: find me a hotel in chicago and put the options in a nice looking html file I can view in my browser.
Reasoning: I need to find hotels in Chicago. I will use a research agent to find some hotels and then create an HTML file to display them.
I have extracted the following hotels in Chicago with their price, address, and amenities:

- Holiday Inn & Suites Chicago-Downtown, an IHG Hotel: $276, Address: Not available, Amenities: Pool, Free Wi-Fi, Air-conditioned, Breakfast
- Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown South Loop: $318, Address: Not available, Amenities: Pool, Free breakfast, Free Wi-Fi, Air-conditioned
- Hotel Saint Clair - Magnificent Mile: $185, Address: Not available, Amenities: Free Wi-Fi, Air-conditioned, Breakfast, Wi-Fi
- Embassy Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown River North: $201, Address: Not available, Amenities: Pool, Free breakfast, Air-conditioned, Breakfast
- Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile: $279, Address: Not available, Amenities: Pool, Free Wi-Fi, Air-conditioned, Breakfast
- Hilton Chicago: $344, Address: Not available, Amenities: Pool, Free Wi-Fi, Air-conditioned, Breakfast
Reasoning: I have a list of hotels and their details. I need to create an HTML file to display this information in a user-friendly format. I will use the 'shell' command along with 'echo' to write the HTML content to a file named 'hotels.html'.
ran command echo '<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Chicago Hotels</title><style>table, th, td { border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse; padding: 5px; }</style></head><body><h1>Chicago Hotels</h1><table><tr><th>Hotel</th><th>Price</th><th>Amenities</th></tr><tr><td>Holiday Inn & Suites Chicago-Downtown, an IHG Hotel</td><td>$276</td><td>Pool, Free Wi-Fi, Air-conditioned, Breakfast</td></tr><tr><td>Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown South Loop</td><td>$318</td><td>Pool, Free breakfast, Free Wi-Fi, Air-conditioned</td></tr><tr><td>Hotel Saint Clair - Magnificent Mile</td><td>$185</td><td>Free Wi-Fi, Air-conditioned, Breakfast, Wi-Fi</td></tr><tr><td>Embassy Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown River North</td><td>$201</td><td>Pool, Free breakfast, Air-conditioned, Breakfast</td></tr><tr><td>Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile</td><td>$279</td><td>Pool, Free Wi-Fi, Air-conditioned, Breakfast</td></tr><tr><td>Hilton Chicago</td><td>$344</td><td>Pool, Free Wi-Fi, Air-conditioned, Breakfast</td></tr></table></body></html>' > hotels.html
